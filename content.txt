**About Me 

  I am Rohan Wagle, a self taught designer from Pune, India. I have worked as a freelancing Graphic designer until now, and I aim to build a career in the feild of designing as it 
fascinates me more than anything in this world. Designing is not just about making your products attractive but also about making it easy to understand 
and easy to use at the same time. I can put my skills to use in order to achieve these objectives. I have completed my Engineering from University of Pune in June 2017 
in the field of Electronics and telecommunication. I came across technical concepts like HTML and CSS which could help me in UI/UX (User Interaction/ User Experience) design. 
Using UI/UX design can be helpful to build a website or an Application much attractive and easy to undersand. I believe my skill set will be beneficial in this particular purpose.
